What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wasn't 100% comfortable with merging branches from the command line as opposed to on github, but now that I tried it out a bit I feel better.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I understand now what happens when you try to merge and have a conflict. Before I just knew what they were theoretically, not practically.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I messed up and missed my GPS because I thought it was 12 PST instead of 12 EST, so thats pretty embarrassing and unfortunate. I had to google the italics syntax in md files, so I guess thats the best analogy?
    
What still confuses you about Git?
I still don't know how to update a fork that you have made with updates that happen to the main project that you forked off of, but that seems more like a  github question than a git question.
    
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Made me feel pretty dumb to miss the time, though I feel like I know git pretty well though, so the actual exercises weren't that hard.
